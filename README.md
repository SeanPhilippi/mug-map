# Mug Map UI

## About
This app was initialized using a React + TypeScript + Vite template.

## Development
Make sure API_URL in constants.ts is set to your localhost url like this: '<localhost_url>:<port>/api'
To start the app run `npm run dev` from the terminal.

You need to have the Flask API running at the same time which can be found at:
https://github.com/SeanPhilippi/mug-map-api
Follow the instructions from the README.md in that repo to start up the Flask API.

## Development Using Docker
Coming soon
